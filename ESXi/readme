## Requirements

### Vagrant VMWareESXi plugin

### VMWare ovftool

### SSH access to ESXi

## Usage

1. Modify Vagrantfile as you need
2. Set environment variable
    - On Windows

        ```powershell
         $env:ESXI_PASS = 'PassWord!@#'
        ```

    - On Linux

        ```bash
        export ESXI_PASS=PassWord!@#
        ```

3. Up the virtual machine

    ```bash
    vagrant up
    ```

## Note

Currently, there are some config that I don't know how to set

- Default user instead of vagrant
- Provisioning disk size
- Set static IP for main Virtual network
